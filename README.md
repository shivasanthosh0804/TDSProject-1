## BulletPoints

### > I used GitHub API to collect the data of GitHub users in Austin with more than 100 followers.I used PythonLibrary **Requests** for making requests to GitHub API.I authenticated with my PersonalAccessToken and saved them into users.csv and repositories.csv files respectively.
  
## An explanation of how you scraped the data

To Scrape the Github Users Data in Austin(Capital CIty of Texas,USA).

1. I used Python and used its libraries - Requests and Pandas.

2. I authenticated with my GithubPersonal AccessToken and searched for users in Austin with over 100 followers using GitHub API.

3. I also got the data of the repositories of each users which i collected before.

4. After some cleaning and processing I saved the data into "users.csv" and "repositories.csv" respectively.
   
### The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data
The most intresting facts that i found out are

1.This shows Austin has highly active technical and software development community.University of Texas might have played a huge role in it.

2.Even though Companies like Google,Microsoft,Oracle appear often in the dataset but its intresting to see a large number of repositories which suggests their contribution towards opensource community.

The most surprising facts that i found out are 

1.JavaScript is more widely used that Python.This suggests that there are low number of users who are into AI and DataScience.

2.Maybe Austin has a strong WebDevelopment community as they used JavaScript a lot and lack of mention of other software development technologies.

3.Its very good to know that the users are concerned about their privacy as they are many few users who have listed their email address.

### An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis

Here are few recommendations to users in Austin 

1.I would ask them to update their profiles with their personal email addresses so that the recruiter can contact them easily , thereby increasing the chances of hiring and maybe the employyed users percentage may increase.

2.As the users are having a more number of repositories , i would suggest them to pin the repositories which they are confident about.

3.This maybe a personal choice of the users but I would suggest the users of Austin to focus on Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning and Data Science fields that would help them in the near future.
