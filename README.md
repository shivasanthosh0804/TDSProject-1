# TDSProject-1 - This project was a part of my ToolsForDataScience Course 

## An explanation of how you scraped the data
1. I have collected the data from GitHub API to find Developers in Austin City( Capital City of Texas,USA) who have more than 100 followers and their repositories on Github .I generated csv files which would describe the developer community over there.

### The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data
The most intresting facts that i found out are
1.This shows Austin has highly active technical and software development community.University of Texas might have played a huge role in it.
2.Even though Companies like Google,Microsoft,Oracle appear often in the dataset but its intresting to see a large number of repositories which suggests their contribution towards opensource community.

The most surprising facts that i found out are 
1.JavaScript is more widely used that Python.This suggests that there are low number of users who are into AI and DataScience.
2.Maybe Austin has a strong WebDevelopment community as they used JavaScript a lot and lack of mention of other software development technologies.
3.Its very good to know that the users are concerned about their privacy as they are many few users who have listed their email address.

### An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis
3. Based on my analysis i would recommend developers to focus on opensource projects as that would not only help in building their own skills and resume but also help in making other peoples life better.
