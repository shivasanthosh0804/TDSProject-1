# TDSProject-1 - This project was a part of my ToolsForDataScience Course 

1. I have collected the data from GitHub API to find Developers in Austin City( Capital City of Texas,USA) who have more than 100 followers and their repositories on Github .I generated csv files which would describe the developer community over there.

2. The most intresting fact that i found out was JavaScript was more widely used that Python and most followed users are mostly from Google but for my surprise Oracle was the second in the list

3. Based on my analysis i would recommend developers to focus on opensource projects as that would not only help in building their own skills and resume but also help in making other peoples life better.
