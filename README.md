# TDSProject-1 - This project was a part of my ToolsForDataScience Course 

1. I have collected the data from GitHub API to find Developers in Austin who have more than 100 followers.I generated a csv file which would describe the developer community over there.

2. The most intresting fact that i found out was JavaScript was more widely used that Python

3. Based on my analysis i would recommend developers to focus on opensource projects as that would not only help in building their own skills and resume but also help in making other peoples life better.
