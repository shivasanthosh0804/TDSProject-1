## An explanation of how you scraped the data

To Scrape the Github Users Data in Austin(Capital CIty of Texas,USA).

1. I used Python and used its libraries - Requests and Pandas.

2. I authenticated with my GithubPersonal AccessToken and searched for users in Austin with over 100 followers using GitHub API.

3. I also got the data of the repositories of each users which i collected before.

4. After some cleaning and processing I saved the data into "users.csv" and "repositories.csv" respectively.
   
### The most interesting and surprising fact you found after analyzing the the data
The most intresting facts that i found out are

1.This shows Austin has highly active technical and software development community.University of Texas might have played a huge role in it.

2.Even though Companies like Google,Microsoft,Oracle appear often in the dataset but its intresting to see a large number of repositories which suggests their contribution towards opensource community.

The most surprising facts that i found out are 

1.JavaScript is more widely used that Python.This suggests that there are low number of users who are into AI and DataScience.

2.Maybe Austin has a strong WebDevelopment community as they used JavaScript a lot and lack of mention of other software development technologies.

3.Its very good to know that the users are concerned about their privacy as they are many few users who have listed their email address.

### An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis
3. Based on my analysis i would recommend developers to focus on opensource projects as that would not only help in building their own skills and resume but also help in making other peoples life better.
